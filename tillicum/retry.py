    If any exception listed in exceptions is raised in the wrapped

    WARNING: This decorator assumes the wrapped function is
    idempotent; that is, that it will perform the same operation when
    called multiple times, and that it does not mutate its arguments
    in such a way that this may be the case. Do not pass generators,
    iterators, or other lazy structures to functions wrapped by this,
    as failed segments will not be retried. Instead, create an outer
    loop which materializes segments into lists or tuples, and pass
    those.
